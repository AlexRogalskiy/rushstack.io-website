## LockFile class

A helper utility for working with file-based locks. This class should only be used for locking resources across processes, but should not be used for attempting to lock a resource in the same process.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class LockFile 
```

## Properties

|  Property | Modifiers | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [dirtyWhenAcquired](./node-core-library.lockfile.dirtywhenacquired.md) |  | boolean | Returns the initial state of the lock. This can be used to detect if the previous process was terminated before releasing the resource. |
|  [filePath](./node-core-library.lockfile.filepath.md) |  | string | Returns the absolute path to the lockfile |
|  [isReleased](./node-core-library.lockfile.isreleased.md) |  | boolean | Returns true if this lock is currently being held. |

## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [acquire(resourceDir, resourceName, maxWaitMs)](./node-core-library.lockfile.acquire.md) | <code>static</code> | Attempts to create the lockfile. Will continue to loop at every 100ms until the lock becomes available or the maxWaitMs is surpassed. |
|  [getLockFilePath(resourceDir, resourceName, pid)](./node-core-library.lockfile.getlockfilepath.md) | <code>static</code> | Returns the path to the lockfile, should it be created successfully. |
|  [release()](./node-core-library.lockfile.release.md) |  | Unlocks a file and removes it from disk. This can only be called once. |
|  [tryAcquire(resourceDir, resourceName)](./node-core-library.lockfile.tryacquire.md) | <code>static</code> | Attempts to create a lockfile with the given filePath. If successful, returns a LockFile instance. If unable to get a lock, returns undefined. |
