## Enumeration Members

|  Member | Value | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  RUSH\_ABSOLUTE\_SYMLINKS | <code>&quot;RUSH_ABSOLUTE_SYMLINKS&quot;</code> | If this variable is set to "true", Rush will create symlinks with absolute paths instead of relative paths. This can be necessary when a repository is moved during a build or if parts of a repository are moved into a sandbox. |
|  RUSH\_ALLOW\_UNSUPPORTED\_NODEJS | <code>&quot;RUSH_ALLOW_UNSUPPORTED_NODEJS&quot;</code> | If this variable is set to "true", Rush will not fail the build when running a version of Node that does not match the criteria specified in the "nodeSupportedVersionRange" field from rush.json. |
|  RUSH\_DEPLOY\_TARGET\_FOLDER | <code>&quot;RUSH_DEPLOY_TARGET_FOLDER&quot;</code> | This environment variable can be used to specify the <code>--target-folder</code> parameter for the "rush deploy" command. |
|  RUSH\_PARALLELISM | <code>&quot;RUSH_PARALLELISM&quot;</code> | Specifies the maximum number of concurrent processes to launch during a build. For more information, see the command-line help for the <code>--parallelism</code> parameter for "rush build". |
|  RUSH\_PNPM\_STORE\_PATH | <code>&quot;RUSH_PNPM_STORE_PATH&quot;</code> | When using PNPM as the package manager, this variable can be used to configure the path that PNPM will use as the store directory.<!-- -->If a relative path is used, then the store path will be resolved relative to the process's current working directory. An absolute path is recommended. |
|  RUSH\_PREVIEW\_VERSION | <code>&quot;RUSH_PREVIEW_VERSION&quot;</code> | This variable overrides the version of Rush that will be installed by the version selector. The default value is determined by the "rushVersion" field from rush.json. |
|  RUSH\_TEMP\_FOLDER | <code>&quot;RUSH_TEMP_FOLDER&quot;</code> | This variable overrides the temporary folder used by Rush. The default value is "common/temp" under the repository root. |
|  RUSH\_VARIANT | <code>&quot;RUSH_VARIANT&quot;</code> | This variable selects a specific installation variant for Rush to use when installing and linking package dependencies. For more information, see the command-line help for the <code>--variant</code> parameter and this article: https://rushjs.io/pages/advanced/installation\_variants/ |
