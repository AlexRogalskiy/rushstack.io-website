The Rush Stack projects are coordinated by a team within MS Office.  Although Microsoft does not provide
official support, there are various community options for help:

- **Found a bug?** You can [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/rushstack/issues)

- **Gitter**: Chat with the Rush Stack developers in the [Gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/rushstack/rushstack)
